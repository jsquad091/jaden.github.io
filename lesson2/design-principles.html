    <p class="repetition-paragraph-1">Apple - <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/">Link</a></p>
    <img class="first" src="images/IMG_3320.png" alt="first">
    <img class="second" src="images/IMG_3321.png" alt="second">
    <img class="third" src="images/IMG_3322.png" alt="third">

    <p class="repetition-paragraph-2"> Here are three screenshots of an example of repetition used on the Apple website. While showing the new features of the new iPad Apple has decided to use a repetition of title, text, then an image. I have posted three examples of the repetition but if you follow the link you will see that they do this more than three times. </p>

<div class="whitespace"> 
    <h2 class="whitespace-headline-1">White Space</h2>
    <p class="whitespace-paragraph-1">Nike - <a href="www.nike.com">Link</a></p>
    <img class="wfirst" src="images/IMG_3324.png" alt="firstw">
    <p class="whitespace-paragraph-2"> Here is a screenshot of the home page of Nike. In this portion of the home page Nike utilizes lots of empty space, or white space. They have minimal text and image and great placement. I could even consider that there is some rule of thirds here as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="contrast"> 
    <h2 class="contrast-headline-1">Contrast</h2>
    <p class="contrast-paragraph-1">Nike - <a href="https://www.nike.com/">Link</a></p>
    <img class="cfirst" src="images/IMG_3323.png" alt="firstc">
    <p class="contrast-paragraph-2">Here is a great example of the use of contrast on a website. On Nike.com you can always expect to see a lot of contrast with text and background as well with images they have. In this particular example, towards the bottom of the homepage of Nike's mobile site we can see the change from a white background with black text to a black background with white text. They did a really good job of maintaining the balance on the page while at the same time showing some contrast.</p>
